### Combinatorial fragmentation benchmark set contains rich, chemical information that can be useful for other applications

The validation set used to benchmark our fragmentation scheme, and determine the disruption threshold to use, was specifically
chosen to validate a fragmentation scheme for QC torsion scan so we wanted molecules that are challenging to fragment.
Therefor, the hundred molecules chosen include bonds that are sensitive to remote
chemical changes and the functional groups they are sensitive to exhibited relatively large, long range effects. However, these molecules
were filtered out from a larger set with a total of 1,234 molecules and ~300,000 fragments with their WBO distributions over conformations.
This exhaustive fragmentation dataset, with their changing WBO distributions, provides a treasure trove of nuanced chemical data. For the purposes
of this paper, we did not delve into interesting effects we observed because it is out of scope. Here we describe
some of those observations, and provide some thoughts on how this kind of data can be useful for other applications.

At closer proximities that was not relevant for this study, and when functional groups are fragmented,
the changes in the distributions detect varied effects. Many of these effects confirmed known considerations, such as removing
a carbonyl from an amide or carboxylic group. But some were more subtle, such as changes observed vis-Ã -vis primary, secondary,
and tertiary amines. The changes seem to pick up on subtle pKa changes for different amines [@doi:10.1002/cmdc.200700059]. In addition, the
shifts in the distributions observed in figure @fig:dabrafenib_wbo_dists are also picking up on the effects of fluorine on sulfinamide.

### Bond orders can be used to fit force field parameters

WBO is one form of quantum mechanical electron density based bond order calculations, among many other definitions of bond orders (Pauling [@doi:10.1021/ja01315a105],
Coulson [@doi:10.1098/rspa.1939.0006], Mulliken [@doi:10.1063/1.1740588]
Mayer [@doi:10/b5m8r5], Jug, [@doi:10.1021/ja00466a009], Politzer  [@doi:10.1063/1.1671457], atomic overlap matrix bond order [@doi:10.1021/ja00011a014],
natural resonance theory bond order [@doi:10/bcrs8w],
Nalewajksi-Mrozek bond order [@doi:10.1002/qua.560510403], effective bond order [@doi:10.1002/anie.200603600],
natural localized molecular orbital bond order [@doi:10.1021/ja00160a022], delocalization index [@doi:10.1021/ja00859a001], fuzzy bond order
[@doi:10.1016/j.cplett.2003.11.048]) that aim to quantify the chemical bond, a key concept in chemistry, by computing the electron population overlap between atoms. These quantities
attempt to provide a link between the physical understanding of molecules, a system of individual particles without explicit bonds, to the powerful, mental, graphical, models
that chemists employ when thinking about molecules. Given that these quantities try to make that connection, it is not surprising that fractional bond orders
captures important, chemical properties that can be useful in many applications. Indeed, In the MMP2 [@doi:10.1002/jcc.540080504],
MM3 [@doi:10.1002/jcc.540110709] and MM4 [@doi:10/ftx79r], a Variable Electronegativity SCF derived bond order for pi-systems was used to fit bond length and force constants and twofold torsional
force constants. Given the relationship we find in figure @fig:subsituted_phenyls, E, we should be able to interpolate torsion force constants by calculating
the WBO, thus avoiding running expensive QC torsion scans. This functionality already exists in the Open Forcefield toolkit [@url:https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield].
The SMIRNOFF format provides a convenient way to add appropriate torsion terms given the data we have. For example, In figure @fig:subsituted_phenyls, E, the lines
seem to cluster into three clusters, so we can us ChemPer [@doi:10.26434/chemrxiv.8304578.v1] to generate SMIRKS patterns to capture the chemistries in
these clusters and interpolate the torsion force constants for the different chemical environments of those patterns. This has the potential to avoid
many expensive QC torsion scnas, specifically for bespoke parameter fitting for new chemical entities.

### Using WBO for molecular similarity

### Using WBO and the other method by Moitessier et al to avoid needing to calculate expensive QM torsion scans entirely.

### Relative changes in WBO is not enough to capture all characteristics of QM torsion scans
* Asymmetric scans
* Profile changes
    * Profile in energy changes but not in wbo in same scan

### Why use AM1 WBO if cheaper rule based conjugation criteria exist

### Using Bond orders when fragmenting molecules captures long range effects that simple rules do not
    * But still, WBO calculations and the recursion can be expensive. Using this data we can derive simple rules that take into account the sensitive bonds and the chemical groups that must remain
    * In addition, since the data is rich and picks up on these subtle changes, it can be possible to train an ML model to fragment molecules
