![**QC gradient evaluations scale similarly on various processor**
CPU time (wall time * nthreads) for one gradient evaluation vs. heavy atoms in molecules. All CPUS shown in this figure
are Intel(R) Xeon(R)](images/SI_Intel_scaling_4.svg){#fig:intel_scaling}

![**QC gradient evaluations scale similarly on various processor**
Same as Figure @fig:intel_scaling but on AMD processors](images/SI_AMD_scaling_3.svg){#fig:amd_scaling}

![**Distributions of number of gradient evaluations per optimizations for different size molecules**
The number of gradient evaluations per optimization depends on many factors such as initialization and tolerance, but there
is also a slight dependency on molecular size as shown in this figure](images/gradients_per_opts_2.svg){#fig:grads_per_opt}

![**Distribution of optimizations per torsion drive**
This figures shows the distributions of optimizations per torsion drive when using wavefront propagation](images/opts_per_td_4.svg){#fig:opts_per_td}

![**Varinace and correlations of WBO distributions with respect to conformations for a set of kinase inhibitors**
This figure shows WBO distributions and correlations for a set of kinase inhibitors calculated at B3LYP-D3(BJ) / DZVP.
Optimized conformations and their WBOs are on QCArchive (`OptimizationDataset`, named `Kinase Inhibitors: WBO Distributions`)](images/SI-KI-all.svg){#fig:kinase_inhibitors}

![**Variance and correlations of AM1 Wiberg bond order distributions with respect to conformations are higher for conjugated bonds**
The trend seen in @fig:wbo_var_corr for higher level of QM theory (B3LYP-D3(BJ) / DZVP) is also observed at AM1.
**[A]** Gifitnib with its rotatable bonds highlighted. **[B]** WBO distributions over 232 conformations of the highlighted bonds. The variance
and their 95% CI is shown. **[C]** Pearson correlation coefficients for WBOs in every bond against all other bonds with respect to conformations.](images/SI-WBO-dist.svg){#fig:si_wbo_dist}

![**Druglike molecules used to calculate ELF10 AM1 WBOs**
This set of molecules were selected to cover bonds of different types and multiplicities](images/druglike_mols_for_wbo_dist_4.svg){#fig:wbo_dist_mols}

![**Validation set**
All molecules used in the validation set of fragmentation schemes. The bonds are highlighted by how sensitive they are to
remote fragmentation. The redder bonds are more sensitive while the WBO distributions around the blue bonds do not change
much with remote fragmentation.](images/figure-10-SI.svg){#fig:full_validation_set}
