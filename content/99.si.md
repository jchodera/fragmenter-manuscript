![**Validation set**
All molecules used in the validation set of fragmentation schemes. The bonds are highlighted by how sensitive they are to
remote fragmentation. The redder bonds are more sensitive while the WBO distributions around the blue bonds do not change
much with remote fragmentation.](images/figure-10-SI.svg){#fig:full_validation_set}
