![**QC gradient evaluations scale similarly on various processor**
CPU time (wall time * nthreads) for one gradient evaluation vs. heavy atoms in molecules. All CPUS shown in this figure
are Intel(R) Xeon(R)](images/SI_Intel_scaling_4.svg){#fig:intel_scaling}

![**QC gradient evaluations scale similarly on various processor**
Same as Figure @fig:intel_scaling but on AMD processors](images/SI_AMD_scaling_3.svg){#fig:amd_scaling}

![**Distributions of number of gradient evaluations per optimizations for different size molecules**
The number of gradient evaluations per optimization depends on many factors such as initialization and tolerance, but there
is also a slight dependency on molecular size as shown in this figure](images/gradients_per_opts_2.svg){#fig:grads_per_opt}

![**Distribution of optimizations per torsion drive**
This figures shows the distributions of optimizations per torsion drive when using wavefront propagation](images/opts_per_td_4.svg){#fig:opts_per_td}

![**Druglike molecules used to calculate ELF10 AM1 WBOs**
This set of molecules were selected to cover bonds of different types and multiplicities](images/druglike_mols_wbo_dist_4.svg){#fig:wbo_dist_mols}

![**Validation set**
All molecules used in the validation set of fragmentation schemes. The bonds are highlighted by how sensitive they are to
remote fragmentation. The redder bonds are more sensitive while the WBO distributions around the blue bonds do not change
much with remote fragmentation.](images/figure-10-SI.svg){#fig:full_validation_set}
