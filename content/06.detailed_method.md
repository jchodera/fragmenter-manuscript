## Calculating Bond orders

### AM1 WBO and AM1 ELF10 WBO
To calculate AM1 ELF10 WBO, we used OpenEye's QUACPAC toolkit [@url:https://www.eyesopen.com/quacpac] (OpenEye version 2019.Apr.2). The
ELF10 WBO comes along free after an AM1-BCC charge fitting procedure. For ELF10 WBOs generated in this paper, we used the `get_charges` function
in the `chemi.py` module in `fragmenter` versions v0.0.3 and v0.0.4. To calculate AM1 WBO for individual conformers, we used the `OEAssignPartialCharges`
with the `OECharges_AM1BCCSym` option from the QUACPAC toolkit for each conformer generated with Omega [@url:https://www.eyesopen.com/omega] (OpenEye versio 2019.Apr.2)
which is called for the `get_charges` function.
For AM1 WBOs calculated to verify the results from the validation set, we generated conformers using the `generate_grid_conformer` function in the `chemi.py` module in `fragmenter`
version v0.0.4.+25.gbb12030

## Datasets

### Kinase inhibitor dataset
The kinase inhibitor dataset consists of 43 FDA approved kinase inhibitors (smi files is in the SI) with their Omega generated conformers (OpenEye veriso 2019.Apr.2, `generate_conformers`
function in the `chemi.py` module in `fragmenter` version v0.0.4). AM1 WBOs were calculated as described above, for all conformers of all 43 kinase inhibitors. B3LYP-D3(BJ) / DZVP Wiberg-Löwdin
bond orders were calculated for 9 kinase inhibitors and Omega generated conformers after a B3LYP-D3P(BJ) / DZVP geometry optimization. The DFT results are available on QCArchive
as an `OptimizationDataset` named `Kinase Inhibitors: WBO Distributions`.

The variance of the WBO distributions were calculated using the numpy [@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2011.37] var function version 1.16.2 and their confidence intervals were calculated using
arch `IIDBootsrap` function [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.2613877] version 4.8.1. To calculate the correlation matrix, we calculated the
Pearson correlation coefficient with the numpy [@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2011.37] `corrcoef` function version 1.16.2.

### Subsituted phenyl dataset
The substituted phenyl dataset consists of 3,458 substituted phenyl molecules where the substituents chosen to span a large range of electron donating and withdrawing
groups. We arrived at 3,200 molecules by attaching 26 different functional groups to 5 scaffolds (Figure @fig:subsituted_phenyl, A) at the X~1~ position, and then
attach the 26 functional group (and H) at the X~2~ position for a total of 133 molecules per functional group (26 * 5  + 3 (for molecules with H at the X~2~ position)).
The AM1 ELF10 WBOs were calculated as described above. We selected molecules for QC torsion scans as follows:
1. From the 26 functional groups, we only selected molecules from 18 functional groups, skipping X~1~s that either did not have a rotatable bond (fluorine, chlorine, Iodine,
bromine, nitrile, oxygen), were too congested (triflouromethyl, trimethylamonium) or where the WBOs on the bonds attaching X~1~ to the phenyl ring did not change much
with different chemical group at the X~2~ position (methyl).
2. For the 18 functional groups, we chose molecules that were evenly spaced along the WBO range of that functional group, up to 15 molecules. While all the skipped
functional groups for X~1~ were allowed to be at X~2~, we did not include the negative oxygen at X~2~ because OpenFF have
not yet benchmarked the level of theory to use for anions.
3. After selection, we had 140 molecules that we submitted to QCArchive for torsion scan. The dataset is available on QCArchive as a `TorsionDriveDataset` named
`OpenFF Subsituted Phenyl Set 1`. This dataset also includes the biphenyl torsion scans shown in Figure @fig:bipenyls

There is another subsituted phenyl set on QCArchive whose results are not shown in this paper because it was run with a different level of theory as the default
OpenFF level of theory, included anions which we did not yet decide how to handle and did not have good coverage of WBO ranges.
