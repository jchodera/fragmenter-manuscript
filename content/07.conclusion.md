## Conclusion

We have shown that the ELF10 WBO estimate is a simple, yet informative quantity about the extent of binding between two connecting atoms,
thus descriptive of a bond's chemical environment, its level of conjugation, and resistance to rotation. We can use
the change in WBO of a bond to quantify the amount of disruption of its chemical environment due to remote chemical
substituent changes, specifically for bonds that are sensitive to peripheral chemical changes such as bonds in or
adjacent to conjugated systems, or bonds involving atoms that have lone pairs.

We used this concept to extend a rule-based fragmentation scheme to improve the resulting fragments, by adding remote substituents
until the change in WBO is lower than a user defined threshold. We generated a validation set using exhaustive fragmentation to
benchmark fragmentation schemes and found that a threshold of 0.03 will find the most fragments that minimize both fragment
size and distance to the parent's conformation distribution about the bond. We found eight chemical groups that have
long-range effects on sensitive bonds and their inclusion is necessary to recapitulate a parent's chemical environment even
if they are 3-6 bonds away from the central bond.
