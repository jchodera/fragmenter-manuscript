## 2. Theory and definitions

### 2.1 A mathematical definition of the problem

A molecular structure can be modeled as a degree bounded graph $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ are the nodes and $E$ are the edges.
In a molecular graph, the nodes correspond to the atoms and the bonds correspond to the edges.
We define rotatable bonds as bonds that are not in rings and they are subset of edges, $e' \in E$.

The weights on the edges are given by $\delta(e')$ where $\delta$ is the RMSE of the torsion potential around the bond in
the full graph vs. a subgraph. We want to find a set of partitions $v$ of $V$ such that for all $v' \in v$, $v' \leq k$ where
k is an integer $4 \leq k \leq |V|-1$. The subgraph $G[v']$ induced by $v'$ is connected and has a minimal total error

$$ RMSE =  \sum_{v' \in v} |\delta(e')|$${#eq:graph}

where $e'$ is the central, rotatable bond in the subgraph $v'$.

Since the $\delta(e')$, RMSE of the torsion scans are expensive to calculate, we use a surrogate, $\gamma(e')$, which we
define as the difference of the WBO on the central bond. We want to minimize @eq:graph subject to the constraint of minimizing
$v'$.

### 2.2 Physical definitions

The torsion energy of a bond is determined by a combination of effects from conjugation, hyperconjugation, sterics and electrostatics
[@doi:10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00585; @doi:10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00645; @doi:10.1038/35079036; @doi:10.1021/jp046290d].
While sterics and elecrostatics are usually local properties or can be controlled by using smaller fragments, conjugation and
hyperconjugation are non local properties and remote chemical changes can influence the extent of conjugation and / or hyperconjugation.
In this study, we aim to mitigate the effects of remote chemical changes on conjugation and hyperconjugation by understanding how
the extent of binding changes with remote chemical changes. Here we define conjugation and hyperconjugation and how we use these
terms in this paper.

Conjugation is defined as the overlap of p-orbital electrons across $\sigma$ bonds [@doi:10.1002/jlac.18993060107; @url:https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/C01267] such as what occurs in
benzene or butadiene. Hyperconjugation is the interactions of electrons in a donating bonding orbital to an anti-bonding orbital [@doi:10.1021/ja01846a008].
There are several modes of hyperconjugation such as $\sigma \to \sigma^*$, $\sigma \to \pi^*$, and $\pi \to \sigma^*$. In this study, for simplicity,
we use the term conjugation to refer to all modes of conjugation and hyperconjugation.
