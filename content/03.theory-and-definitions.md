## 2. Theory and definitions

### 2.1 A mathematical definition of the problem

A molecular structure can be modeled as a degree bounded graph $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ are the nodes and $E$ are the edges.
In a molecular graph, the nodes correspond to the atoms and the bonds correspond to the edges.
We define rotatable bonds as a set bonds in the molecule that are not in rings, $\mathcal{E} \subset E$, and $\mathcal{G}$ as a set
of allowable subgraphs, where each subgraph $G'(V', E') \in \mathcal{G}$ is built around a central, rotatable bond, $e' \in \mathcal{E}$
with the following conditions:

* The number of atoms in $G'$, $|V'|$, are $4 \leq |V'| \leq |V|$
* The minimum edges in $G'$ are $e'$ and all $e \in E$ such that $e, e'$ share a vertex
* All $v \in V$ adjacent to $e$
* If $v \in V'$ is in a ring in $G$, the ring should be included in $G'$

The weights on $e'$ are given by $\delta(e'; G')$ where $\delta$ is the RMSE of the torsion potential around the central, rotatable bond in
the full graph vs. a subgraph. Since $\delta(e'; G')$ is computationally expensive, we use a surrogate, $\gamma(e'; G')$, which we
define as the difference of the WBO on the central, rotatable bond $e'$ in $G'$ and in the full graph $G$.
In order to calculate the WBO, we need to cap open valences. The rule we use are defined in section 3.4.

We want to minimize $\gamma(e'; G')$, while also minimizing the cost of each subgraph. We define the cost as estimated in @fig:b3lyp_scaling

$$ c(G') \propto (|V'|)^{2.6} $$

Which leads to minimizing

$$ \sum_{e' \in \mathcal{E}} |\gamma(e';  G') - c(G'; e')|$$

The search space of $\mathcal G$ for each rotatable bond is combinatorial and its upper bound is ${|V|\choose{4}} + {|V|\choose{5}} + ... {|V|\choose{|V|}}$
since all $G' \in \mathcal G$ need to be connected and rings are not fragmented. To reduce the search space, we also define a list
of functional groups that should not be fragmented in @tbl:fgroups.

Given how large the search space can become, we use several heuristics as described in section 3.4.

### 2.2 Physical definitions

The torsion energy function (or profile) of a bond is determined by a combination of effects from conjugation,
hyperconjugation, sterics and electrostatics
[@doi:10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00585; @doi:10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00645; @doi:10.1038/35079036; @doi:10.1021/jp046290d]. Most of these effects
are non-local. For this study we define local as atoms within two bonds of the central bond of a torsion and remote as any atom
beyond those two bonds.

Sterics and elecrostatics are in principle handled by non bonded terms in most force fields, so a torsion profile should
represent conjugation or hyperconjugation, and only the 1-4 electrostatics. Using small fragments to generate QC torsion profiles
reduces non-local electrostatics and steric interactions from convoluting the data. However, conjugation and
hyperconjugation are non local properties and remote chemical changes can influence the extent of conjugation and / or hyperconjugation.
In this study, we aim to mitigate the effects of remote chemical changes on conjugation and hyperconjugation by understanding how
the strength of the central bond changes with remote chemical changes. Here we define conjugation and hyperconjugation and how we use these
terms in this paper.

Conjugation and hyperconjugation describes the sharing of electron density across several bonds.
Conjugation is formally defined as the overlap of p-orbital electrons across $\sigma$ bonds [@doi:10.1002/jlac.18993060107; @url:https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/C01267] such as what occurs in
benzene or butadiene. Hyperconjugation is the interactions of electrons in a donating bonding orbital to an anti-bonding orbital [@doi:10.1021/ja01846a008].
There are several modes of hyperconjugation such as $\sigma \to \sigma^*$, $\sigma \to \pi^*$, and $\pi \to \sigma^*$. In this study, for simplicity,
we use the term conjugation to refer to all modes of conjugation and hyperconjugation.
