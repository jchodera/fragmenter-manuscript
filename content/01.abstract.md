## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Accurate molecular mechanics force fields for small molecules are essential for predicting protein-ligand binding
affinities in drug discovery and understanding the biophysics of biomolecular systems. 
Torsional potentials are important for determining the conformational distribution of molecules, and can have a large effect 
on computed properties like binding affinities. 
These potentials, particularly for conjugated bonds, can be strongly affected by through-bond chemistry distal to the torsion itself.
The force field torsion parameters needed to reproduce the torsional potential, including these effects, are usually fit to computationally costly 
quantum chemical (QC) torsion scans that scale poorly with molecule size. 
To reduce computational cost and avoid the complications of distal through-space intramolecular interactions, 
molecules are generally fragmented into smaller entities to carry out QC torsion scans. 
Poor fragmentation schemes, however, have the potential to significantly disrupt
electronic properties of the region around the torsion, leading to poor representation of the parent molecule's chemical environment and the resulting torsion energy profile.
Here, we show that a rapidly computable quantity, the fractional Wiberg bond order (WBO), is sensitive to the chemical
environment of bonds, and can be used as a surrogate to assess the robustness of fragmentation schemes and identify
conjugated bond sets. 
We use this concept to construct a validation set consisting of exhaustive fragmentations of
druglike organic molecules (and their corresponding WBO distributions derived from accessible conformations) that can be used to evaluate fragmentation schemes.
To illustrate the utility of the WBO in assessing fragmentation schemes that preserve the chemical environment, 
we propose a new fragmentation scheme that uses rapidly-computable AM1 WBOs, 
available essentially for free as part of an AM1-BCC partial charge assignment process, 
to maximize the chemical equivalency of the fragment and the substructure in the larger molecule.
