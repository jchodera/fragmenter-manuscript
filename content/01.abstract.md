## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Accurate small molecule molecular mechanics force fields are essential for predicting protein-ligand binding 
affinities in drug discovery and understanding the biophysics of biomolecular systems. The accuracy of torsion 
parameters is important for determining the conformational distribution of molecules, and can have a large effect 
on computed properties like binding affinities. Torsion parameters are usually fit to computationally costly 
quantum chemical (QC) torsion scans that scale poorly with molecule size. To reduce computational cost and avoid 
the complications of distant intramolecular interactions, molecules are generally fragmented into smaller entities 
to carry out QC torsion scans. Poor fragmentation schemes, however, have the potential to significantly disrupt the 
electronic properties of the region around the torsion, leading to poor representation of the real chemical environment. 
Here, we show that a rapidly computing quantity, the fractional Wiberg bond order (WBO), is sensitive to the chemical 
environment of bonds, and can be used as a useful surrogate to assess the robustness of fragmentation schemes and identify 
conjugated bond sets. We use this concept to construct a validation set consisting of combinatorial fragmentations of 
druglike organic molecules (and their corresponding WBO distributions) that can be used to evaluate fragmentation schemes. 
To illustrate the utility of the WBO in assessing fragmentation schemes that preserve the chemical environment, we propose 
a new fragmentation scheme that uses WBO to maximize the chemical equivalency of the fragment and the substructure in the 
larger molecule.
